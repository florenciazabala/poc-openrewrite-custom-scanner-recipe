# Include any Declarative YAML format recipes here, as per:
# https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/yaml-format-reference
# These are most easily composed through the Yaml recipe builder at:
# https://app.moderne.io/recipes/builder

# Notice how we can have multiple recipes in the same file, separated by `---`
# You can also have multiple files in `src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite`, each containing one or more recipes.
